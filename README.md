# Metrics collection setup in my home automation setup

This repository contains a few docker containers running on my raspberry pi for the purpose of metrics collection and display
of my electricity meter.

Metrics are collected using ]libsml-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/neiser/libsml-prometheus-exporter), stored in prometheus and
displayed via grafana.
